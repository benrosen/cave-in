# Cave-In

## Description

You are an adventurer trapped deep within the forgotten dungeon Eldrath's Sorrow. Your goal is to navigate through the
dungeon one room (card) at a time until you've made it through the entire dungeon (deck).

## Game Rules

### Game Setup

1. Shuffle all the cards to form the deck.
2. Draw two cards from the deck to form your starting hand.
3. Set your health to 6 by using the D12 health dice.
4. Set your luck to 1 using the D6 luck dice.

### Game Zones

- **Deck**: This is the draw pile. It contains cards you have yet to encounter.
- **Hand**: This is your current hand of cards. It contains the cards you've drawn and can use.
- **Discard**: This is the discard pile. Cards used or discarded from your hand end up here.

### Turn Sequence

1. Draw a card from the deck.
2. Play a card from your hand and follow the instructions written on the card.
3. Discard the played card into the discard pile.
4. Check your health. If it's zero or less, you've lost the game. If not, it's the start of your next turn.

### Card Instructions

The actions you'll take are dictated by the instructions on the cards you play. These may include drawing or discarding
cards, rolling the fate die, adjusting your health or luck, and various effects influenced by your fate rolls.

### Fate Rolls

Some cards require a fate roll. For these, roll the D6 fate dice and follow the card's instructions for the outcome.

### Health and Luck

You track your health using the D12 health dice and your luck using the D6 luck dice. Certain card instructions will
cause these values to increase or decrease. If your health reaches zero or less, you've succumbed to the dungeon's
perils and lost the game.

### Luck Mechanic

The Luck Mechanic allows you to spend luck points to improve your fate rolls. For example, if you have 3 luck points and
you roll a 3 for your fate roll, you could spend all your luck points to turn that roll into a 6. Each luck point spent
reduces your current luck total by 1.

### Winning the Game

To win, you must successfully navigate through all the rooms (draw and play all the cards) in the dungeon. If you've
used all the cards in the deck and are still standing (health greater than 0), you've escaped the dungeon and won the
game!
