			"creationMyth": "In the primordial age, the All-Father, an omnipotent deity, conjured the first celestial beings - the Dragons. These beings birthed stars as they roamed the formless void. However, they yearned for a world of their own, and the All-Father granted them this wish. Once terrestrial, they fashioned a vibrant world from the formless terrain. The All-Father sculpted another mighty race, the Giants, from the very stones of the earth. Recognizing their shared connection to the land, Dragons and Giants formed an alliance, shaping the continents and landscapes. With the advent of time, mortal races sprang from the Giants' blood, embodying the potential to mold the world. The All-Father granted them free will, enabling the creation of empires and the initiation of wars. The world, once under the harmonious rule of Dragons and Giants, splintered due to strife and conflict amongst these mortals.",
			"setting": "Sequestered in the heart of a lush forest is the ancient dungeon of Eldrath's Sorrow. This relic, a testament to the time when Dragons and Giants held sway, was once a sacred proving ground for mortals see favor from these ancient beings. The once magnificent halls, adorned with intricate carvings and statues symbolizing the unity of Dragons and Giants, now lay derelict, ensnared by nature's reclaim. Yet, the dungeon remains a formidable fortress, housing monstrous creatures drawn to its lingering ancient energy. Traps lay waiting for the unsuspecting, ready to unleash their dormant wrath. Scholars and seekers of forgotten lore are drawn to Eldrath's Sorrow, hoping to uncover remnants of ancient artifacts and unlock secrets buried within its halls. Despite its decay, the dungeon's echoes of the past tell a tale of unity, conflict, and the unending struggle between darkness and light."
